#+STARTUP: showeverything

* Rosemacs
   Since we are using emacs >= 24, we can not install it via 'sudo apt install ros-kinetic-rosemacs'.
   We have to clone it into a catkin_ws, compile it and install it by hand.

** Build 
   mkdir -p <WS>/src
   cd <WS>/src
   git clone https://github.com/code-iai/ros_emacs_utils.git
   catkin_make

** Install to /opt/ros/kinetic
   sudo su
   source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash
   catkin_make install -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/ros/kinetic                                       

** Add to emacs.el
   See README.md in cloned git repo
